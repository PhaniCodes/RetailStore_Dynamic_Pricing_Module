My goal in starting this project is to practice machine learning. I have thought about many real world scenarios and decided to build a dynamic pricing module which can be integrated into a basic store management system.

My plan is to create a store management system that automatically adjusts the selling price of products based on factors like demand, stock levels, seasonal trends, and customer behavior using machine learning.

## 🔧 Key Features
- Predictive pricing model
- Historical sales tracking
- Pricing decisions based on stock
- Pricing based on Seasonal and temporal demands
- Integration-ready for store platforms


## 🔍 ML Focus
- Regression models (Linear, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Time series forecasting (Prophet, ARIMA)
- Reinforcement learning

## 💾 Data Sources (Initial Plan)
- Gather data from online sources (sales and inventory data)
- Time features (date, season, holiday)
- Customer segmentation & competitor pricing

## 📂 Modules (Planned)
- Data Simulator
- ML Model Trainer
- Dynamic Price Predictor
- Store Inventory Manager (basic CRUD)
- Dashboard

## 📈 Milestones
1. Simulate realistic store data
2. Build regression-based price predictor
3. Create a backend module to adjust prices
4. Integrate into a basic store dashboard
