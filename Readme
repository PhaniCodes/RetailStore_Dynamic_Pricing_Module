My goal is to practice machine learning. I have thought about many real world scenarios and decided to build a dynamic pricing module which can be integrated into a basic store management system.

My plan is to create a store management system that automatically adjusts the selling price of products based on factors like demand, stock levels, seasonal trends, and customer behavior using machine learning.

## ðŸ”§ Key Features
- Predictive pricing model
- Historical sales tracking
- Pricing decisions based on stock
- Pricing based on Seasonal and temporal demands
- Integration-ready for store platforms
